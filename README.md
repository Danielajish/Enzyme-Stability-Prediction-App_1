# Enzyme Thermostability Prediction Model
# Overview
# This repository contains a predictive model for estimating the thermostability of enzymes at a given pH level based on the protein's structural features. The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide valuable insights into an enzyme's stability, particularly in diverse pH conditions.

## Features
## Utilizes structural data: The model is designed to analyze the structural properties of enzymes, including but not limited to amino acid sequences, secondary structure elements, and more.

## pH-specific predictions: The model's key feature is its ability to predict enzyme thermostability at different pH levels, making it highly adaptable for a wide range of applications.

## Machine learning at its core: Our model is powered by machine learning algorithms, which have been trained on a diverse dataset of enzymes with known pH-dependent thermostability. This extensive training data ensures accurate and reliable predictions.
